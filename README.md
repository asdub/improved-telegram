### Project Description

I have created an app to promote the services of a freelance designer. 
Allowing users to purchase custom design services. 
Specifically illustrations/ artwork in the form of Icons, Logos, Posters and general Custom Artwork.

Users can select from a variety of design services, select and enter their desired customisations. 
The user has the option of creating a profile to keep all their orders in one place and view or download their artwork. 
In addition, users receive email notifications regarding the status of their order. 

Site admins can add, edit or delete services. 
And also complete user orders by uploading completed artwork.

## User Experience (UX)


### Brief

My intention was to create a simple app that permits the user easy and considered access to the design services being presented.
Users can easily navigate and purchase design services and check on an orders status. While administrators can easily complete user orders, via an upload feature.

Having previously designed my own layouts and styles, I wanted to use a front-end framework with my own custom styling (and layouts in parts) for this project. The app has been built using the [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.1/getting-started/introduction/) front-end framework.


Owing to the services, the user base is likely to be very broad. 
With this in mind the design and layout has been considered to appeal to all age groups and demographics. 


#### The aim of this project is to:
- Be simple and easy to use (as always!)
- Visually pleasing. 
- Provide users with a structured and easy to navigate freelance services. 
- Allow users to purchase a service (Stripe).
- Allow users to customise their service.
- Allow users to manage their address data (CRUD). 
- Provide users with email & on screen notifications regarding their ordered services.
- Provide defensive design in terms of data editing or deletion. 
- Provide seamless login/ registration functionality.
- Allow administrators to manage services. 
- Allow administrators to complete user orders. 

#### Business/ Monetisation
- The app provides an ecomm platform. An unlimited number of products or services can be added to the database. Managed by the administrator.


#### New User Stories
##### General
- I want the app purpose to be obvious or easy to figure out.
- I want to view recent artworks purchased by other users.
- I want to know about the service provider before purchase.
##### Services
- I want to view all available services.
- I want detailed information on each service. 
- I want the ability to search for services by keyword.
- I want to customise each service. 
##### Managing Services
- I want to update my order quantities. 
- I want to remove items from my order.
- I want to see the total cost of each order item. 
- I want to see a breakdown of customisation costs. 
##### Checkout/ Payments
- I want a simple payment process. 
- I want to know of any issues with payment. 
- I want to see payment confirmation and a summary of my order. 
##### Order Success
- I want to know when my order is available. 
- I want to easily access my order. 


#### Returning & Regular User Stories
- I want to view my order history. 
- I want to view the status of my order. 
- I want to view or download my order artwork. 
- I want to update my delivery address.


#### Site Owner/ Admin Stories
- I would like to add a service. 
- I would like to edit a service.
- I would like to delete a service. 
- I would like to see pending user orders. 
- I would like to complete a user order:
    - with the ability to upload user ordered artwork. 
    - and notify a customer when artwork is available. 



## Design 

### Frameworks (front-end)
The [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.1/getting-started/introduction/) front-end framework was used as the base app. 
With additional custom css. 

The app uses the following Bootstrap content, components & utilities:
- [Grid Layout](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.1/layout/grid/)
- [Typography](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.1/content/typography/)
- [Images](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.1/content/images/)
- [Tables](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.1/content/tables/)
- [Forms](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.1/components/forms/)
- [Card](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.1/components/card/)
- [Dropdowns](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.1/components/dropdowns/)
- [Toasts](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.3/components/toasts/)
- [Several Utilities Features](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.3/utilities/)


### Colours 
A limited palette of colours was used throughout the app. 

**There are four colours used in total throughout the app.**

Purple - *#6b63ff*\
<img src="https://github.com/asdub/improved-telegram/blob/main/readme/colours/6b63ff.png" width="75" alt="Purple - #6b63ff" />

Wireframes were completed for desktop, tablet & mobile devices. 


### Typography

[Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) is in use on this app.

To keep on the simplicity brief,
Only one font is in use:\
**Roboto** in weights of 400 & 600.

<img src="https://github.com/asdub/improved-telegram/blob/main/readme/type_icon/roboto_font.png" width="250" alt="Google Fonts - Roboto" />


### Iconography

All primary icons in this project are from [Noun Project](https://thenounproject.com/).\
With secondary icons from [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/).

The following SVG icons have been used throughout the app:\
<img src="https://github.com/asdub/improved-telegram/blob/main/static/img/noun_checkout.svg" height="60" alt="Noun Project Icons"/>
<img src="https://github.com/asdub/improved-telegram/blob/main/static/img/noun_person.svg" height="60" alt="Noun Project Icons"/>

An amazing open source project by Katerina Limpitsouni. 

*Example SVG*

<img src="https://github.com/asdub/improved-telegram/blob/main/static/img/portfolio.svg" width="400" alt="unDraw"/>


### Responsive 

The app uses the [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.1/getting-started/introduction/) front-end framework.
Which is fully responsive. Bootstrap uses a 12 column grid system for layout.

The app renders in three layouts for mobile, tablet and desktop. 
Additional css media queries have been included to ensure a consistent experience across device types. 


### App Flow
*App Flow Diagram*\
<img src="https://github.com/asdub/improved-telegram/blob/main/readme/screenshots/flow.drawio.png" width="400" alt="App Flow Diagram"/>


Users will initially land at */home*, a single page scroller containing a work/ portfolio section display the 8th most recent completed customer artworks.
And also an about and social contact section.
A large header (in all views) with dropdown navigation allows the user to quickly search, access account facilities and order bag. Dropdown menus allow the users to navigate to individual services, all services, or can sort the services by price, rating and type. 
Home contains a hero banner with a large CTA. Taking the user to an all services view.

Selecting a service takes the user to a detailed view. And features the customisation options available to the user. 
The user can add a service to their order from here. A toast notification will prompt the user to 'View their orders' where they can access their order bag. Or from the shopping card icon within the header. 

In the order bag view, the user can review their orders and customisations. See their item and total pricing. 
And also a breakdown of their customisation costs. A user can amend order quantities and remove items. 
A user can proceed to checkout/ payment from here. 

The checkout view displays an order summary, a customer form and payment facilities. 
Once the user completes their transaction, they are directed to an order success view, which details the order just made. 
A user will also receive an automated email confirming their order.  

A site administrator has access to a management view where they can add new products and check pending orders. 
An admin can access the complete customer order functionality from here. Where an admin can see an overview of pending customer orders. They can upload the customer artwork, once the admin selects complete - the customer will receive an email confirming their artwork is available to download and has been shipped. The email contains a link to view and download the artwork. 
If the user has an account setup they can view their historical orders and artwork (if complete). 

The apps functionality is explored in further detail in the [Features](#features) section below. 


### Database Design

As this app uses the Django web framework , the included default object-relational mapping layer (ORM) is used. 
Django uses SQLite by default Heroku Postgres in production. 

*Database Schema Overview*\
<img src="https://github.com/asdub/improved-telegram/blob/main/readme/screenshots/db_schema.png" alt="Database Schema Diagram"/>

Data is organised around 5 core apps, the models associated with these apps are detailed below. 
The diagram above displays the relationships between these models. 

|  App    |  Model                                      |

### Django
Django is an open source framework for web development in Python. It is a flexible web development tool that can be used to create almost any type of website or app that is needed. Thanks to it's high usage, and extensive packages - there is often no need 'to reinvent the wheel' when deploying apps. And trusted and proven code can be used to deploy your project. 

Django's most powerful feature is its object-relational mapper (ORM), allowing the interaction with a database in a pythonic way - with no need need for SQL queries. 

Check out the [database schema](#databasedesign) above to see how this apps database is structured. 

The following Django dependencies apply to this app:

## Deployment

#### Fork
1. [Login](https://github.com/login) to your GitHub account([or join](https://github.com/join)).
2. Go to the repo by clicking [here](https://github.com/asdub/5km-parks-MP2).
3. Click fork in the top right corner of the screen. 

#### Clone (Locally)
1. [Login](https://github.com/login) to your GitHub account([or join](https://github.com/join)).
2. Go to the repo by clicking [here](https://github.com/asdub/5km-parks-MP2).
3. On the main page of the repository click on 'Code'. 
4. Click on the 'Clipboard'/ copy the clone URL (Clone with HTTPs). 
4. In your local environment open your terminal, navigate to or create a directory.
5. Paste the URL into your terminal and enter. The repo should be successfully cloned.  

#### Deploy on Heroku
Deploying the app on Heroku is very straightforward. 


*Initial Heroku Setup*

Go to [Heroku](https://dashboard.heroku.com/) and login or create an account. 

1. Click on 'new' in the top right corner and then create app. 
2. Choose a name and select your region 
3. Your app overview will load. 
4. Select Resources > Add-ons, and choose Heroku Postgres - the 'Hobby Dev or Free' option.
5. Copy the the Postgres URI into a custom variable in settings called 'DATABASE_URL'


*Database Migration*

Back in the apps settings.py, the database settings need to be updated.
> Locate the default 'DATABASE' settings, and replace with:
 ```
 if 'DATABASE_URL' in os.environ:
    DATABASES = {
        'default': dj_database_url.parse(os.environ.get('DATABASE_URL'))
    }
else:
    DATABASES = {
        'default': {
            'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.sqlite3',
            'NAME': os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'db.sqlite3'),
        }
    }
```
*This piece of code checks the env for 'DATABASE_URL'. If false the default sqlite db is loaded. If true, the heroku postgres db is loaded via the dj_database_url dependency.*

Next you will need to run migrations. 
1. You can achieve this by running the following commands:
    ```
    python3 manage.py showmigrations 
    ```
    Check the output of the above contains migrations for each of the apps, once happy run:
    ```
    python3 manage.py migrate
    ```
2. Now that we have migrated the database, we need to load the data. The initial data for this app came from a JSON [fixture](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.2/howto/initial-data/). Run the following commands to load the date:
    ```
    python3 manage.py loaddata categories
    ```
    Followed by:
    ```
    python3 manage.py loaddata products
    ```
    *Data must be loaded in order based on the models relationship.

3. Install gunicorn webserver with:
    ```
    Pip3 install gunicorn
    ```

4. Generate an up to date requirements.txt 
    > Make sure you are in the apps main folder and enter the following command:
    ```
    pip freeze --local > requirements.txt
    ```

5. Generate a Procfile, this tells Heroku to start your app.
    > You can create one by typing the following into your terminal:
    ```
    echo "web: gunicorn improved_design.wsgi:application" > Procfile
    ```

6. In the main apps settings.py, add the Heroku apps URL to 'Allowed Hosts', also include 'localhost'.

*Heroku Setup Continued*

6. Login into Heroku CLI with:
    ```
    heroku login -i
    ```
    Enter your login credentials when prompted. 
7. Temporarily disable collectstatic with:
    ```
    heroku config:set DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC=1 --app {app name}
    ```
8. Initialise Heroku git remote with: 
    ```
    heroku git:remote -a {app name}
    ```
9. Now we are ready for the initial commit to Heroku:
    ```
    git push heroku master
    ```
10. Back on the Heroku dashboard, we will setup automatic deploys. Navigate to Deploy > Deployment Method > Select GitHub. Search for your repo and then click connect. Then click enable automatic deploys. 


#### AWS Setup

*Initial Setup*
1. Go to https://aws.amazon.com/ > Create or Login to your AWS account. 
2. On the management console select or search and select 'S3'
3. Select 'Create Bucket' and populate the name field. 
4. Deselect 'block all public access' and select the related warning.
5. Click 'Create Bucket'

*Bucket Setup*
1. Under Properties 
    - Enable 'Static Website Hosting' in order to get an endpoint.
    - Set the defaults to index.html and error.html - these won't be used. 
2. Under Permissions:
    - Add the following CORS configuration:
    ```
    [
        {
            "AllowedHeaders": [
                "Authorization"
            ],
            "AllowedMethods": [
                "GET"
            ],
            "AllowedOrigins": [
